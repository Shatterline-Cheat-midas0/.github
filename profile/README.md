## 🛠️ How to Use the Cheat

1. **Close anti-virus + overlays (Discord/Game Bar)**
2. Launch your **cheat injector or private loader**
3. Start Shatterline

## 🧠 Smart Use Tips

* Use **low FOV aimbot** for legit-looking flicks
* Turn off ESP while spectated to stay under the radar
* Use **bone targeting** (chest or neck) to avoid headshot spam suspicion
* Don’t snap aim across the map — tweak your smoothing settings
* Keep your settings saved in multiple configs for ranked vs. casual matches

Used right, this cheat makes you uncatchable in pubs and nearly undetectable in comp.

## ⚠️ Ban Safety & Warnings

* Use **private loaders or paid menus** to avoid detection
* Avoid abusing rage settings (snapping, full body tracking, etc.)
* Don’t brag about hacks in voice or chat — that’s report bait
* Always stay updated post-patch — stale code gets caught
* Use an **HWID spoofer** if you're stacking cheats on one machine

Shatterline has active anti-cheat, but a private mod menu with good injection logic and smart user habits is tough to track.
